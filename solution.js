// Ensure that your CSS is correctly imported and that you've purged your CSS.
// Also check that there are no conflicting styles overriding the hover styles. 
// Check for typos in the class names. Even a small mistake can cause an issue
// Add !important to your hover state to see if it's being overridden.
<div class="bg-red-500 hover:bg-blue-700 !important">
  Hover me!
