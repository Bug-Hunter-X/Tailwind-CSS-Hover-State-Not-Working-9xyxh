# Tailwind CSS Hover State Not Working

This repository demonstrates a common issue where Tailwind CSS hover states do not apply correctly. The issue occurs when the class names are correct, and the Tailwind configuration is valid, but the changes to the UI are not reflected when the user interacts with the element. The solution is included to demonstrate a fix.
